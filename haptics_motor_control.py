Module: haptics_motor_control.py
Author: Pi Ko (pi.ko@nyu.edu)
Description:
    This module provides two interfaces to test motors on the bHaptics vest:
    - Funnelling Effect: Using continuous x,y coordinates (0.0 to 1.0)
    - Discrete Motor Access: Using motor indices (0 to 19)

    The vest has 40 motors total:
    - 20 motors on the front panel
    - 20 motors on the back panel

    Coordinate Systems:
    1. Continuous (Funnelling):
    - X: 0.0 (left) to 1.0 (right)
    - Y: 0.0 (bottom) to 1.0 (top)

    2. Discrete:
    - Motor indices: 0 to 19 for each panel
    - Arranged in a grid pattern on the vest

Usage:
    Install dependencies if you haven't already:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Simply run this script:
        $ python haptics_motor_control.py
