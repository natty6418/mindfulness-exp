Module: haptics_pattern_player.py
Author: Pi Ko (pi.ko@nyu.edu)
Description:
    This module demonstrates how to load and play a haptic tact file on the bHaptics jacket/tactsuit.
    The specified tact file "AIMlab_Haptics_Jacket_Patterns.tact" is registered and played exactly once.
    Detailed debugging information is printed to the console and all potential exceptions are caught and logged.
    During playback, the percentage of the total pattern completed is displayed.
    
Usage:
    Install dependencies if you haven't already:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Simply run this script:
        $ python haptics_pattern_player.py

    Loads and plays the haptic tact file for the bHaptics suit.
    
    This function performs the following steps:
        1. Initializes the bHaptics haptic player.
        2. Registers the specified tact file ("AIMlab_Haptics_Jacket_Patterns.tact")
           under a designated registration key.
        3. Prints device connection statuses for debugging purposes.
        4. Submits the registered tact pattern for playback.
        5. Monitors the playback status and prints debug messages, including the
           percentage of the total pattern completed, until the pattern finishes playing.
    
    All steps are wrapped in try/except blocks to handle any exceptions that may occur.
